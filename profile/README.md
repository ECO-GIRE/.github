<!-- PROJECT TITLE AND SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
<h1 align="center">ECO-GIRE</h1>
  <p align="center">
    Ecological and sustainable water availability solutions through comprehensive management of natural resources.
    The main objective of ECO-GIRE is to design a monitoring system using methods and tools for the water cycle, which considers inflows and outflows related to a wide variety of natural and artificial storage systems. Sustainable and integrated water resources management (IWRM) requires tools that allow the quantitative and qualitative characterization of water resources in the complex network of natural and artificial water storage systems.
The project involves developing and installing sensors to collect real-time data on the quantity and quality of incoming and outgoing water for each reservoir. This approach will provide a rich database, which needs to be elaborated with appropriate big data processing instruments to help decision makers and water experts, and ultimately to ensure the quantity and quality of water available. . for end users.
Study and implement wastewater treatment based on ecological techniques. The design of innovative and ecologically sustainable treatment plants and new treatment technologies distributed over the territory and less expensive than those currently used is of paramount importance for a sustainable, integrated and innovative management of water resources. Reclaimed water can be obtained at low cost and used for irrigation or for artificial recharge of natural and artificial water reservoirs.
